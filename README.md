Location of this repo: `main` branch of [https://github.com/gregsandell/fox-python-test](https://github.com/gregsandell/fox-python-test)

## The instructions were:
Instructions for Candidate
* Write clear, idiomatic Python with type hints where reasonable.- Add brief comments or
  docstrings to explain non-obvious logic.
* Use Dummy Data or APIs
* Aim to complete the tasks in 60–90 minutes.
### Task 1 – String & Collections
Implement most_common_word(text: str, stopwords: set[str] | None = None) -> str | None.
### Task 2 – Data Structures & Algorithms
Implement merge_intervals(intervals: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]].
### Task 3 – OOP Design & API Thinking
Create a Logger class with log, get_logs, and search using a dummy API or Open API.
### Task 4 – Debugging & Refactoring
Fix fib function and provide iterative and memoized versions.
### Task 5 – Hashing & Grouping
Implement group_anagrams(words: list[str]) -> list[list[str]].

## Status of my work:
I began with work on Friday Dec 5.  [Commit acac8f8](https://github.com/gregsandell/fox-python-test/commit/acac8f8e6e51434b96f4428c86521da65c67ac1b) is my last commit of the weekend (Sunday night Dec 7). 

As of that commit here is the status of my work:

1. Task 1 - completed
2. Task 2 - completed
3. Task 3 - completed.
4. Task 4 - Skipped because: problem with instructions...no broken `fib` function was provided
5. Task 5 - completed

> Note: Task 3 has a README of its own

## Testing tasks 1-3
